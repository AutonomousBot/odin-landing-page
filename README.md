Odin Project: Landing Page

The goal of this project is to replicate the styles of a typical web page as shown in the .pngs in this very folder. I will be applying what I have learned so far of CSS, flexbox especially. The page will show how much the characters of Realm of the Elderlings series by Robin Hobb have suffered in the Farseer Trilogy.
